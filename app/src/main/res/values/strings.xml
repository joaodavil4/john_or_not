    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is João, also Jon :D.
\n\nI love videogames.
\n\nKind of addicted to it, but not so much.
\nFun fact is that I have only one physical game and it\'s my favorite Dark Souls 2.
\n\nI am vegetarian since two years,
\nAnd is very funny to discover new foods that I always denied like the famous Broccoli.
\n\nI love to play sports, like Swimming, Running, Cycling and Bodybuilding too :)
\nI think, though.\n\n</string>
